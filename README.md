<h1 align="center">Resources for Beginner Front End Developers</h1>

Hello!

I built this repo so I could curate a directory of resources I have found incredibly useful in my learning journey to be a web developer with zero experience. I hope that in creating this repo, I am able to provide even a little bit of help to all budding developers (like me :relaxed:!).

One of my primary motivations is to help beginner devs to be able to easily contribute to open-resource projects. So feel free to contribute to this repo! If you have suggestions, would like to submit new resources, and/or have noticed typo/grammar mistakes, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

You earn contributions. I learn from you. Everyone learns. Win-win-win for everyone!

With that out of the way, I wish you well on your endeavors. Happy coding!! :grin:
